# Cursor CLI

Cursor CLI lets you interact with AI agents directly from your terminal to write, review, and modify code. Whether you prefer an interactive terminal interface or print automation for scripts and CI pipelines, the CLI provides powerful coding assistance right where you work.

## Getting started

```
# Install (macOS, Linux, WSL)
curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash

# Install (Windows PowerShell)
irm 'https://cursor.com/install?win32=true' | iex

# Run interactive session
agent
```

## Interactive mode

Start a conversational session with the agent to describe your goals, review proposed changes, and approve commands:

```
# Start interactive session
agent

# Start with initial prompt
agent "refactor the auth module to use JWT tokens"
```

## Modes

The CLI supports the same modes as the editor. Switch between modes using slash commands, keyboard shortcuts, or the `--mode` flag.

ModeDescriptionShortcut**Agent**Full access to all tools for complex coding tasksDefault**Plan**Design your approach before coding with clarifying questionsShift+Tab, `/plan`, `--mode=plan`**Ask**Read-only exploration without making changes`/ask`, `--mode=ask`
See [Agent Modes](/docs/agent/modes) for details on each mode.

## Non-interactive mode

Use print mode for non-interactive scenarios like scripts, CI pipelines, or automation:

```
# Run with specific prompt and model
agent -p "find and fix performance issues" --model "gpt-5.2"

# Use with git changes included for review
agent -p "review these changes for security issues" --output-format text
```

## Cloud Agent handoff

Push your conversation to a [Cloud Agent](/docs/cloud-agent) to continue running while you're away. Prepend `&` to any message:

```
# Send a task to Cloud Agent
& refactor the auth module and add comprehensive tests
```

Pick up your Cloud Agent tasks on web or mobile at [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents).

## Sessions

Resume previous conversations to maintain context across multiple interactions:

```
# List all previous chats
agent ls

# Resume latest conversation
agent resume

# Resume specific conversation
agent --resume="chat-id-here"
```
